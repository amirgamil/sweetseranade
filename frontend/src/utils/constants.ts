Listen up people, this story's real
Of two hearts in love that's beyond the steel
Yasmin and Raj, they fell so fast
But they were separated, torn apart at last

Chorus:
They met on the terrace under the moonlight
Their love was strong, but their world took flight
They both had to leave, their fate was sealed
But Yasmin and Raj, their love was revealed

Verse 2:
Raj stayed behind, with a broken heart
Places that he loved, now falling apart
But he said with pride, with a smile so bright
"Even if our bodies are apart, our hearts will always beat as one, with all our might"

Chorus:
They met on the terrace under the moonlight
Their love was strong, but their world took flight
They both had to leave, their fate was sealed
But Yasmin and Raj, their love was revealed
